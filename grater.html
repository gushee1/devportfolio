							<h2>Overview</h2>
								Grater is an engine I originally started programming as part of the curriculum for a new class at the 
								University of Michigan, <a href="https://eecs498.com/">Game Engine Architecture</a>. Over the course
								of the semester, each student in the class iteratively built up their engine from a simple text adventure 
								game to the expressive engine it is today. <br>

								After a semester of following laid out guidelines, we were left to our own devices, encouraged to add 
								custom features, and start to take ownership of the engines we created.

								So far, the technologies I have used to build this engine include 
								<b>
									C++, ASIO, SDL, Box2D, Lua, LuaBridge, and GLM.
								</b>
							
							<h2>Multiplayer Support Implementation</h2>
							<h3>
								Week 2 (4/22/2024)
							</h3>
								This week, my main goal was to reliably send messages over my network, as I ended last week only able
								to send 1 message from each client, with crashes and corruption being very common. Though at first I 
								thought this would be a quick fix, as I customized my client/server more and integrated it into my 
								engine, I realized that I would need a foundational knowledge of ASIO's networking protocol and multithreading
								to correctly implement my required functionality. That being said, I spent much of the week reading up on these 
								technologies, tuning my network code as I went. I finished the week with finally achieving consistent and low-latency 
								messages being sent over the network, with my server being able to interpret all of them without dropping any.
								This now leaves me in a good spot to begin to start sending images from the server to the client and further designing
								the Lua API in the coming weeks. I will also be aiming to implement a fixed timestep and begin to implement 
								multiplayer across more than 1 machine, as my tests so far have been between two instances of the program both 
								running on my machine. Check out my video update on this weeks progress!

							<h3>
								Week 1 (4/17/2024)
							</h3>
								When beginning to think about the customizations I wanted to bring to my engine, my mind immediately
								went to multiplayer support. Unity, Unreal, Godot and others already exist and provide amazing and
								and performant tools to help game designers make incredibly diverse and impressive games. However, 
								one thing I noticed is that across the 3 of them, online multiplayer is not front and center, and 
								often requires a bit of overhead to get familiar with the tools and get it working.<br>
								While I would never think to compete with one of these massive engines at this point, when I look 
								at games such as <a href="https://agar.io/#ffa">Agar.io</a>
								(a simple web game I remember playing in high school), I see a game that requires very 
								little technical sophistication, but would greatly benefit from an engine with a very simple scripting
								interface to make multiplayer experiences. <br>
