							<h2>Overview</h2>
								Grater is an engine I originally started programming as part of the curriculum for a new class at the 
								University of Michigan, <a href="https://eecs498.com/">Game Engine Architecture</a>. Over the course
								of the semester, each student in the class iteratively built up their engine from a simple text adventure 
								game to the expressive engine it is today. <br>

								After a semester of following laid out guidelines, we were left to our own devices, encouraged to add 
								custom features, and start to take ownership of the engines we created.
							
							<h2>Multiplayer Support</h2>
								When beginning to think about the customizations I wanted to bring to my engine, my mind immediately
								went to multiplayer support. Unity, Unreal, Godot and others already exist and provide amazing and
								and performant tools to help game designers make incredibly diverse and impressive games. However, 
								one thing I noticed is that across the 3 of them, online multiplayer is not front and center, and 
								often requires a bit of overhead to get familiar with the tools and get it working.<br>
								While I would never think to compete with one of these massive engines at this point, when I look 
								at games such as <a href="https://agar.io/#ffa">Agar.io</a>
								(a simple web game I remember playing in high school), I see a game that requires very 
								little technical sophistication, but would greatly benefit from an engine with a very simple scripting
								interface to make multiplayer experiences. <br>
