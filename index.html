							<h2>More About Me</h2>
							<div class="split style1">
								<section>
									<p>In addition to my love for software, I love being active, watching great movies, and playing board games 
										or video games with friends. During my freshman year at the University of Michigan, I was on the Michigan 
										Men's Rowing Team for the 2020-2021 season. During a difficult and strange COVID season, I learned
										a lot about self discipline and teamwork, and got a lot of peaceful hours on the water through the freezing 
										cold Michigan Winter. Though I have since left the team to focus more on my academics, I continue to enjoy
										the outdoors through my outdoor calisthenics hobby. I have always loved movies and games of all kinds, which
										is what has drawn me to the games industry as a professional career. A few of my all time favorites are Skyrim:
										The Elder Srolls, The Witcher 3, Enter the Gungeon, and Brawlhalla, though I also love playing Mario Kart and 
										The Settlers of Catan with friends. If you have any more questions about me or my work, feel free to check out
										my resum&eacute; or contact me through any of my listed channels!
