  <p>For Metroid, I implemented Samus's logic with regard to jumping, running, sprite control, and animation. Additionally, 
    I created all enemies and programmed their movement, as well as other associated logic with enemies (pickup drops, etc.)<br>
    For our custom level, I came up with the mechanic idea and planned and implemented the level design. 
    Additionally, I wrote the code to toggle between metal and normal states.
