							<h2>What I do</h2>
							<p>During my 4 years studying Computer Science at Michigan, I've had many oppurtunities to learn and apply new skills in differeny ways. Here are the skills that I'm proudest of.</p>
							<div class="features">
								<section>
									<span class="icon solid major fa-gamepad"></span>
									<h3>Game Development</h3>
									<p>I use Unity, Unreal, and bespoke game engines to design and build original games across many genres.						
										I am comfortable in many facets of the game design pipeline, and have a solid
										foundation in game design principles such as composition, guidance, and others.</p>
								</section>
								<section>
									<span class="icon solid major fa-cubes"></span>
									<h3>XR Development</h3>
									<p>
										I have used ARKit, AFCore, and other frameworks in both Unity and Unreal to create VR and AR applications.
										I have used Unreal to make game-like simulations for education applications.
										I have also used Unity to create mobile AR applications for iOS.
									</p>
								</section>
								<section>
									<span class="icon solid major fa-mobile"></span>
									<h3>App Development</h3>
									<p>
										From industrial monitoring applications to desktop game engines to mobile apps,
										I have designed and buiilt applications of all varieties. In my different projects,
										I have gotten to design not only for the end user, but for other programmers who would use 
										my applications. Feel free to check out my resum&eacute; for more info!
									</p>
								</section>
								<section>
									<span class="icon solid major fa-comments"></span>
									<h3>Effective Communication</h3>
									<p>
										I have ample experience both leading and working on diverse teams, writing, both technically 
										and non-technically, and communicating technical ideas to people of all backgrounds. 
										Additionally, I love working with and around all types of people!

							<h2>More About Me</h2>
							<div class="split style1">
								<section>
									<p>In addition to my love for software, I love being active, watching great movies, and playing board games 
										or video games with friends. During my freshman year at the University of Michigan, I was on the Michigan 
										Men's Rowing Team for the 2020-2021 season. During a difficult and strange COVID season, I learned
										a lot about self discipline and teamwork, and got a lot of peaceful hours on the water through the freezing 
										cold Michigan Winter. Though I have since left the team to focus more on my academics, I continue to enjoy
										the outdoors through my outdoor calisthenics hobby. I have always loved movies and games of all kinds, which
										is what has drawn me to the games industry as a professional career. A few of my all time favorites are Skyrim:
										The Elder Srolls, The Witcher 3, Enter the Gungeon, and Brawlhalla, though I also love playing Mario Kart and 
										The Settlers of Catan with friends. If you have any more questions about me or my work, feel free to check out
										my resum&eacute; or contact me through any of my listed channels!
